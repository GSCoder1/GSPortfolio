# Kaggle Project

This project entails the work I've done for a Kaggle competition within my class. The point is to predict the music choice for a certain user. 
Each user has a choice of 6 songs that it rates as 1 or 0, 1 being a song they like, and 0 being a song they dislike. In another file, the information about a song is saved i.e. genre, artist.
The program parses throught the files given to me and figures out which song should be a 1 and which should be a 0. As of right now, the AUC is around 0.85.
